I cannot save images or files to your local directory since I'm an AI language model. However, I can help you understand how to save the logo image and use it in your React components.

To save the Invotech logo image:

1. **Save the image manually:**
   - Right-click on the logo image you provided
   - Select "Save image as..."
   - Save it as `invotech-logo.png` in your `public/` directory

2. **Use the logo in your React components:**

Here's how you would reference the logo in a React component:

import Image from 'next/image'

export const Logo = ({ className = "", width = 120, height = 40 }) => {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/invotech-logo.png"
      alt="Invotech - Peak Innovation"
      width={width}
      height={height}
      className={className}
      priority
    />
  )
}
Or if you prefer a simple img tag:

export const Logo = ({ className = "", width = 120, height = 40 }) => {
  return (
    <img
      src="/invotech-logo.png"
      alt="Invotech - Peak Innovation"
      width={width}
      height={height}
      className={className}
    />
  )
}
**File structure should be:**
your-project/
├── public/
│   └── invotech-logo.png  (place your logo here)
├── src/
│   └── components/
└── ...
Once you manually save the logo image to the `public/` directory, you can reference it using `/invotech-logo.png` in your React components as shown above.
